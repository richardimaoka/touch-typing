She feld the dog lift late as she jogged into the field;
He talked of the fate of those dolls; I said I feld fine
She had no sign of the noon fog; The lane had soon gone;
Half of a fish had hidden in the sea; she held his head;
Dag gashed his leg; a lad held a fig; see a haffa field;
Dad gashed his leg; a lad held a fig; see a jaffa field;
He likes a dig; she likes a dig; all liked a dig; a lass
Slay the nasty hog. Layit on the shelf in the tool shed
The yolks of the little eggs lay shining in the toy toin
His eys said it all He talked of this feeling of hate.
I said that htye yelled in joy at the toys on the shelf.
The lads yelled as they yanked the leg of a little lass
They all liked seeing the toys shining gaily on a shelf.
