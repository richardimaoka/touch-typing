A sad lad asks a lass; all dads fall alas; a jaffa falls
Dad asks a lad; alas alass falls; Dad falls sasd; a lass
Dad asks a lad; alas a lass falls; Dad falls sad; a lass
Jill filled a field; Jill feeds a lass; Jill kisses Dad;
A lad killed a lass; a seal leaked alas; feed Dad seeds;
He likes a dig; she likes a dig; all liked a dig; a lass
 Dad gaashed his leg; a lad held a fig; see a jaffa field; 
Half of a fish had hidden in the sea; she held his head;
she had no sign of the noon fog; The land had soon gone;
He talked of the fate of those dolls; I said I felt fine
She felt the fog lift late as she jogged in to the filed;
