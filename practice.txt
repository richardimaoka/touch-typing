Querying
In some cases, issueing an HTTP GET request to a BigQuery URL is not enough. More information is required from the client. IN such cases, the API requires that the client issue an HTTP POST and send along a JSON request in the body of the request.

For example, to run a BigQuery SQL query and obtain the results, issue an HTTP POST request to

and send in a JSON of the following form:

Sometimes the query results are too large to be sent in a single HTTP response. Instead the results are provided us in chunks. Recall, however, that REST is a stateless protocol and the server does not maintain session context. Therefore, the results are actually stored in a temporary table that is maintained for 24 hours. The client can page through this temporary table of results using a page token that servers as a bookmark for each call to get query results.
