There were 3 dogs, 33 cats, and 330 hamsters at the park.
I saw 7 people on Monday, 77 on Tuesday, and 7 yesterday.
Weigh out 4 oz of flour, 4 oz of suger and add the eggs.
At 8 o'clock I went out to see the 88horses at the show.
I had 1 suit, 1 pair of trousers, 1 skirt and 11 jumpers.

The amazing monkey scampered quickly over the floor of the case. He was very excited as his keeper was just about to feed him.

The extra homework given to the children did nt keep them quiet and they jumped about the desks with ferocious zeal.

Jenny Pope was a fun loving, likeable gir.
