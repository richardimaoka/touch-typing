a lad had a fine dog; he held his lead; he jogged in a lane
fog had soon hidden all signs of a field; he fell on a log;
she had a fine salad and half of a fish; she soon had none;
he had a fine nose; she had gone insane; she had a finenfig
sad lad and his dog had gone jogging in a field and he fell
jed dosed on a log; he soon had no dog; he had gone inside;
