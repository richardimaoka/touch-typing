I said I hated the doll and that I felt it had a tin leg;
She talked of Noel and said she asked if she hated jogging
Ask to see Don and see if he sells gates; tents and dolls
I said I felt fine and that I jogged in a field at night;
He let his dog loose in the field and he finished in a lake
The fog had filled the field and I fell on a sagging log;
