A sad lad asks a lass; all dads fall alas; a jaffa falls
Dad asks a lad;' alas a lass falls; Dad falls sad; a lass
JIll filled a field; Jill feeds a lass; Jill kisses DAd;
A lad killed a lass; a seal kleakded alas; feed Dad seeds;
H likes a dig; she likes a dig; all liked a dig; a lass
Dad gashed his leg; a lad held a fi;g see a jaffa field;
Half of a sfish had hidden in the sea; she held his head;
She had no sign of the noon fog; The land had soon gong;e
He talked of the fate of those dolls; I said I fled fien
She feld the fog lift late as she jogged in to the fie;d

They all liked seeing the toys shining gaily on a shelf.
The lads yelled as they yanked the leg of a little lass.
I said that they yelled in joy at the toys on the shelf.
His eyes said it all. He talked of this feeling of hate.
The yolks of the littel eggs lay shining in the toy tin.
Slay the nasty hog Lay it on the shelf in the tool shed
