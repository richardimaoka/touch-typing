There were 3 dogs, 33 cats, and 330 hamsters at the park. 
I saw 7 people on MOnday, 77 on Tuesday, and 7 yesterday.
Weigh out 4 oz of flour, 4 oz of sugar, and add the eggs.
At 8 o'clock I went out to see the 88 horses at the show.
I had 1 suit, 1 pair of trousers, 1 skirt and 11 jumpers.
The 2 of us saw 2 plays at the theatre on the 22nd August.
If you add 6 and 6 and 6 you will find the right answers.
I think 5 is a nice round figure; 5 people and 5 animals.
On the 9th September we went out at 9 pm in 9 cranky cars.
The value is 0, but we really need a value of 100 or 200.
Jane had 239 bars of chocolate, 56 lollies and 76 sweets.
Add 569 to the totals of 890 and then you will have 1459.
