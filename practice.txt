There are amny opportunities available for a good secretary. A company will be only too pleased to promote a secretary to personal assistant or even higher if she has proved to be capable of more responsibility. The appointment to a higher position may be subject to a reference from the person's present boss, who should make sure the necessary information is received prior to interview by whoever is concerened with interviewing for the promotion.

The more a company offers to its employees, the more it should expect to receive in return. I believe sufficient thorught should be given to developing a structure of promotion which will apply to all.:`:
