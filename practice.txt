 sad lad asks a lass; all dads fall alas; a jaffa falls
Dad asks a lad; alas a lass falls; Dad falls sad; a lass
JIll filled a field; Jill feeds a las; JIll kisses Dad;
A lad killed a lass; a seal leaked alas; feed Dad seeds;
He likes a dig; she likes a dig; all liked a dig; a lass
Dad gashed his leg; a lad held a fig; see a jaffa field;
Half of a fish had hidden in the sea she held his head; 
She had no sign of the noon fog The land had soon gone;
He talked of the fate of those dolls; I said I felt fine
She felt the fog lifg late as she jogged into the field;
