She felt the fog lift late as she jogged into the field;
He talked of the fate of those dolls; I said I felt fine
She had no sign of the noon fog; The lane had soon gone;
Half of a fish had hidden in the sea; she held his head;
Dad gashed his leg; a lad held a fig; she a jaffa field
He likes a dig' she likes a dig; all liked a dig; a lass
Slay the nasty hog. Lay it on the shelf in the tool shed
The yolks of the little eggs lay shining in the toy tin.
His eyes said it all. He talked of this feeling of hate.
I said that htye yelled in the joy at the otsys of the shelf
I said that they yelled in joy at the toys of the shelf.
The lads yelled as they yanked the leg of a little lass.
They all liked seeing the toys shinnig gaily on a shelf.
